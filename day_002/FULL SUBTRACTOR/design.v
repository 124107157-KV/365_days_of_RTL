endmodule

// The Difference (DIFF) is computed using the XOR operation: DIFF = A ^ B ^ BIN. It gives the result of subtracting B and BIN from A.
// The Borrow out (BOUT) occurs when a borrow is needed from the next higher bit.
// The borrow logic is: BOUT = (~A & B) | (BIN & (~A ^ B)), which handles cases where either A < B or thereâ€™s a borrow in (BIN).
